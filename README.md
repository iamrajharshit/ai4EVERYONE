## Introduction to AI

###  Artificial intelligence (AI), three key concepts shape its evolution and impact:

- **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI):** ANI refers to AI systems tailored for specific tasks or narrow domains. These systems excel in performing predefined tasks but lack adaptability beyond their designated scope. Examples include virtual assistants like Siri and recommendation algorithms.

- **Generative AI (Gen AI):** Gen AI encompasses AI technologies capable of generating new content, such as text, images, or audio, indistinguishable from human-generated content. This includes models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and image generators like DALL-E.

- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):** AGI represents the aspirational goal of creating AI systems with human-like cognitive abilities, capable of performing any intellectual task a human can. Unlike ANI, AGI exhibits general intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and adaptation across various tasks and contexts.
